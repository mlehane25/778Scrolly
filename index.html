                    <h2>What is Park Equity?</h2>
                    <p>Not every community has access to parks, in fact according to the Trust for Public Land, roughly 1 in 3 Americans don't have a park within a 10-minute walk. Park access is crucial for the mental, physical, and environmental health of a community. Annually, the Trust for Public Land put's out their ParkScore Index report, which ranks the park systems of America's 100 most-populous cities. The goal of this report is to determine where parks are needed most in the nation's cities. In 2024, Arlington County, Virginia was ranked #5 by the ParkScore Index. Nearby Washington, D.C. ranked #1 best park system by the ParkScore Index in 2024.</p>

                    <p2>According to multiple studies, oftentimes marginalized and low-income communities have less access to parkspace than white, affluent comunities.</p2>
                    <p>Arlington County, Virginia, like many American cities, implemented exclusionary housing policies decades ago that still affect housing, demographics, and development today. In 1932, Arlington was "formally" split in two via the street naming system, streets ending in "North" were north of Route 50 and those ending in "South," south of Route 50. However, the cultural and economic disparities between North and South Arlington began well before that system was put in place. In the early 20th century, there was one black neighborhood north of what is now Route 50/Arlington Boulevard, High-View Park/Hall's Hill. Furthermore, there were housing covenant's in North Arlington that forbade the sale or lease of homes “to anyone not of the Caucasian race.” Although these covenant's are no longer in place, there are lasting impacts on real estate values. </p>

                    <p>Arlington County, Virginia is currently one of the most expensive places to live in the country, especially North Arlington. The map to the left shows the percent of the total population below the poverty line. There are very few census tracts with more than 4% of residents below the poverty line and the census tracts with the highest rates of poverty are south of Route 50, in South Arlington. In some South Arlington elementary schools, more than 80% of students qualify for free or reduced lunches. Furthermore, in some North Arlington elementary schools, less than 5% of studenst qualify for free or reduced lunches. Wealth and income are an important measure for the ParkScore Index. According to the ParkScore Index, residents in the low-income neighborhoods of Arlington have 19% less park space per person than those in the average Arlington neighborhood and 33% less than those in high-income neighborhoods. Additional local studies have backed up this data outcome, including one by the Arlington County Civic Federation.</p>

                    <p>In 2021, the Arlington County Civic Federation found that residents living in areas with median incomes below $125,000 typically have significantly less open public spaces
                        within walking distance or proximity than residents living in areas with median incomes above $125,000. This, combined with the finding that white Arlington County Public Schools (APS) elementary students have greater proximity to tree canopy than do black, hispanic, or
                        asian APS elementary students.</p>
                    <p2>These findings in Arlington County correlate with studies that marginalized, low-income communities have less access to nature.</p2>
